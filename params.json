Get a **heroku** account.\r\n2. `cd` to here\r\n3. `heroku create my-awesome-time-tracker`\r\n4. `git push heroku master`\r\n\r\nYou're done installing it! It will be visible under the domain heroku tells you.\r\n\r\nHow to use?\r\n===========\r\nSimply use http://www.getharvest.com/ like you would always, then deploy Zealot and configure it (copy the `conf.yml.sample` as `conf.yml` and fill in the details).\r\n\r\nDeploy to heroku (or wherever you want - as zealot has no dependencies like databases etc), and you're done!\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nI hereby release **Zealot** under the **Beerware** license. A definition of the license can be read up on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beerware\r\n\r\nI've chosen this license as the project is pretty much \"anyone can do that\", and it's a copy paste hackfest in the views ;-) Having that said, if you want to\r\nuse or extend it - pull requests with minor (or major) tweaks would definitely be really awesome :+1:\r\n"}
