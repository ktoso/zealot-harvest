How to install?
===============
1. Get a **heroku** account.
2. `cd` to here
3. `heroku create my-awesome-time-tracker`
4. git push heroku master

You're done installing it! It will be visible under the domain heroku tells you.

How to use?
===========
Simply use http://www.getharvest.com/ like you would always, then deploy Zealot and configure it (copy the `conf.yml.sample` as `conf.yml` and fill in the details).

Deploy to heroku (or wherever you want - as zealot has no dependencies like databases etc), and you're done!
